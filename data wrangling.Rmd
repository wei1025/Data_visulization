This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


# part1: dplyr

original setup
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE,
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.height = 4,
  fig.width = 8,
  fig.align = "center",
  cache = FALSE
)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(scales)
library(readr)
library(ggmap)
library(HLMdiag)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(gridExtra)
library(GGally)
```

# filter function( filter the part we want)
```{r}
data(french_fries, package = "reshape2")
french_fries %>%
    filter(subject == 3, time == 1)
#Note: filter function here to filter subject and time
```

#Arrange (arrange the ordering of the value)

```{r}
french_fries %>%
    arrange(desc(rancid)) %>%
    head
#note: here we ordering rancid in a descending way
```

# Select (select the variable we want)

```{r}
french_fries %>%
    select(time, treatment, subject, rep, potato) %>%
    head
```

#summarise (use to calculate the statistic)
( summarise itself is not helpful; but combine with Group_by, it becomes super helpful)
summarise and group_by
```{r}
french_fries %>%
    group_by(time, treatment) %>%
    summarise(mean_rancid = mean(rancid), sd_rancid = sd(rancid))
```

Now, we use these four functions of dplyr to answer five questions

Question1: check data completeness

#check data completeness
```{r}
head(french_fries)
french_fries %>% select(subject, time, treatment) %>% tbl_df() %>%
count(subject, time) %>% spread(time, n)
```

#Check completeness with different scales, too
```{r}
french_fries %>% 
  gather(type, rating, -subject, -time, -treatment, -rep) %>%
  select(subject, time, treatment, type) %>% 
  tbl_df() %>% 
  count(subject, time) %>%
  spread(time, n)
```

#Change in ratings over weeks, relative to experimental design

```{r fig.show='hide'}
ff.m <- french_fries %>% 
  gather(type, rating, -subject, -time, -treatment, -rep)
ggplot(data=ff.m, aes(x=time, y=rating, colour=treatment)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(subject~type) 
#Note: the figure is really a messy, we need to summarize them
```

#clean the data by summarize
(summarise can show the statistic, make the figure beautiful)
```{r fig.show='hide'}
ff.m.av <- ff.m %>% 
  group_by(subject, time, type, treatment) %>%
  summarise(rating=mean(rating))
#note: summarse the mean of rating and the figure will become more beautiful
ggplot(data=ff.m, aes(x=time, y=rating, colour=treatment)) + 
  facet_grid(subject~type) +
  geom_line(data=ff.m.av, aes(group=treatment))
```

Question2: whether replicates like each other

for potato part
```{r}
ffp <- french_fries %>% select(time, treatment, subject, rep, potato) %>% spread(rep, potato)
#note: select the key variable and then spread into wider form
ggplot(ffp, aes(x =`1`, y = `2`)) +geom_point()
```

for all part
```{r}
ff_all <- ff.m %>% spread(rep, rating)
ggplot(ff_all, aes(x =`1`, y = `2`)) + geom_point(aes(color=type))
```

#part2  working with lots of models(bloom package)

original setup

1. first look at the data
```{r}
library(gapminder)
ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, group=country)) + 
  geom_line()
```

2. Using models as exploratory tools
(fit a line to each one of countries' life expectancies; then use intercept and slope to characterise groups of countries)

# using purrr package
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
```

# look at usa data
```{r}
usa <- gapminder %>% filter(country=="United States")
head(usa)
ggplot(data=usa, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point()
 ggplot(data=usa, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method="lm", se=F)
 lm(lifeExp~year, data=usa)
```

#How to do parallel modeling and extract the value:
IMPORTANT! nest, map, unest,bloom package
 

##part3 Use biobroom package to analyze biological data

original setup
```{r}
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("biobroom")
library(biobroom)
data(hammer)

counts <- Biobase::exprs(hammer)
head(counts)
```

1. identify differentlially expressed genes(clean data)
```{r}
library(edgeR)
y <- DGEList(counts = counts, group=Biobase::phenoData(hammer)@data$protocol)
y <- calcNormFactors(y)
y <- estimateCommonDisp(y)
y <- estimateTagwiseDisp(y)
et <- exactTest(y)

glance(et, alpha = 0.05) # glance on DGEExact
```

2. use tidy and get significance(positive and negative difference)

```{r}
tet <- tidy(et)
tet$significant <- tet$p.value < 0.05
ggplot(data=tet, aes(x=logCPM, y=estimate, colour=significant)) +
  geom_point(alpha=.1) + facet_wrap(~significant)
```

3. limma is usually to microarray data
